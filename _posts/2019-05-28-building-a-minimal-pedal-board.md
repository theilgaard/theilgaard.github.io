What better way to start off a technical blog mostly about code with a completely unrelated post about my new electric guitar pedal board. Well it features a bit of _hacking_ so there's that..

### Motivation
Lately I have begun picking up my electric guitar more often and cared more about sound than I previously have. This led me to purchase a [Fender Telecaster](https://www.thomann.de/fender_deluxe_nashville_tele_dpb_pf.htm), which I have long regarded as the most badass guitar ever made. It has a punk attitude with a classic feel. 

In extension of this purchase, I have been wanting to switch out my Korg multi-effects board for individual pedals simplifying my setup. Mostly due to my multi-effects board being too complicated when playing in a band setting, it does more harm than good.

### Minimalism
I wanted to go small with this board. I don't really care for big bulky things, so mini pedals suited my taste perfectly. Being Danish, I of course opted for TC Electronics pedals ;)

With a [Harley Benton PowerPlant ISO-1 Pro](https://www.thomann.de/harley_benton_powerplant_iso_1_pro.htm) not really fitting the [Pedaltrain Nano+](https://www.thomann.de/pedaltrain_nano.htm) I bought, I had to resort to some Dremel maintenance on the board itself.

After the cut, it was time to plan the stacking of the pedals. I opted for a pretty vanilla Compressor -> Overdrive -> Chorus -> Reverb, excluding the loop pedal and tuner.

The fit came out really well, and with the flat patch cables I can probably even fit a Wah pedal at some point.

If you want to fit the Harley Benton PowerPlant ISO-1 Pro, go ahead and buy a Dremel first. You will need to hack away some excess aluminium off the pedalboard before making the fit.
