### About me
I am a _Computer Scientist_ based in Copenhagen, Denmark with a general interest in technology. My main interests within the gigantic field of Computer Science is _Security_, in which I compete in _Capture The Flag_ hacking competitions. It is a great way of learning new languages, protocols, file formats, etc. This site is maintained mostly for my own amusement, to _recollect stuff I have learned_, and to force myself into communicating concisely about a technical topic.

### Contact
I can be reached by [e-mail](mailto:kristian.theilgaard@gmail.com), or via one of the social medias in the top right corner of this site.
